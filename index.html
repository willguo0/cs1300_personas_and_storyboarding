        Key Observations of Users
        </h2>
        <body>
            Some key observations made when observing the users were that most users 
            seemed very familiar with the interface. A very large majority of the users 
            seemed very practiced working through the different steps of the interface, 
            often not reading the prompts and instructions and quickly moving through 
            the process. Furthermore, users were able to successfully finish the process 
            most of the time w/o any external assistance. The few times that they did need
             assistance occurred when the interface forced external intervention(interface 
             requested assistance for the user and stops progressing). Additionally, most 
             users followed the same user journey through the interface, scanning -> pay 
             with the bagging step taking place anytime between during scanning to after 
             paying. Some users(store workers) only interacted with part of the overall 
             process – helping regular users with the scanning step or paying step.
